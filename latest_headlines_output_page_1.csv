Novak, for example, has talked about the allure of books that are fun to hear being a ""gateway drug"" to get kids hooked on literature.

Incumbent President Jonathan Nez and challenger Buu Nygren emerged as the top two vote-getters among 15 candidates in the tribe's primary election in August. Both want to ensure that tens of thousands of people on the country's largest Native American reservation have access to running water, electricity and broadband. The coronavirus pandemic highlighted the lack of basic services across the Navajo Nation and led to more than $2 billion being allocated by the federal government, some of which will fund infrastructure projects.;12news.com;11293;politics;US;en;Felicia Fonseca;https://media.12news.com/assets/KPNX/images/a925784b-841d-4989-ae71-384ba1308fcb/a925784b-841d-4989-ae71-384ba1308fcb_1140x641.jpg;False;12News;;ac77a871b34480a4f350e598056fe754

Prominent figures on social media, including some of the loudest voices on the political right, are pushing a salacious and false conspiracy theory about the attack on House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's husband, in an apparent attempt to shift the narrative about the assault.

The claim that big names like Elon Musk, Donald Trump, Jr., and Dinesh D'Souza have promoted to millions of their followers: Paul Pelosi and the man who attacked him were gay lovers who had gotten into a fight.

The spurious theory traces back to an incorrect early news report and a handful of pieces of evidence that its proponents have spun wildly out of context.";cnn.com;61;politics;US;en;Casey Tolan,Curt Devine,Daniel A.
